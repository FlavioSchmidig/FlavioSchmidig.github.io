I am a Cognitive Neuroscientist interested in Memory and Sleep. 
At the moment I am engaged as a postdoctoral researcher at Tel Aviv University in the Nir-Lab. Here, I am deepening my understanding of how memories are transformed by sleep. To this end, I have gratefully received three scholarship of the Sagol School of Neuroscience.

I hold a PhD as well as a master's degree from the University of Bern - in Psychology / Cognitive Neuroscience. Within the framework of my PhD I examined how de-novo memory formation during deep sleep can be improved. 

Additionally and something that is dear to me: I have gained leadership and project management experience over many years as a voluntary instructor of "Jugend+Sport" (Youth and Sports) as well as a board member of Jungwacht Blauring.
