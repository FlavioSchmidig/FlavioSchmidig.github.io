title: "Anticipatory eye gaze as a marker of memory"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/naturecommspsych
excerpt: 'Using the MEGA paradigm, anticipatory eye movements during repeated movie viewing provide a nonverbal, single-trial index of associative memory—predicting salient events seconds in advance, enabling machine-learning classification, dissociating recollection (gaze) from familiarity (pupil dilation), and revealing sleep-related retrieval benefits—thus extending memory assessment beyond verbal report.'
