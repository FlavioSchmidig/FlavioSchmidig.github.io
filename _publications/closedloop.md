title: "Closed-loop modulation of local slow oscillations in human NREM sleep"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/closedloop
excerpt: 'We introduce TOPOSO, a real-time EEG closed-loop algorithm that topographically targets local UP/DOWN states of slow oscillations—overcoming single-channel limitations—producing fewer but region-specific stimulations, reliably hitting frontal/sensorimotor/centro-parietal UP-states in naps and transiently enhancing the targeted local state before a canonical frontal slow oscillation emerges, thereby enabling precise modulation and study of local slow-oscillation function.'
